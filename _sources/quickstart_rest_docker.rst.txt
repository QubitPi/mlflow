Quickstart: Running Machine Learning Model as REST API in Docker Container
==========================================================================


In this quickstart, we will:


Deploying a trained machine learning model behind a REST API endpoint is an common problem that needs to be solved on
the last mile to getting the model into production. The MLflow package provides a nice abstraction layer that makes
deployment via Docker quite easy.


Defining and Storing the Model as a Python Function in MLflow
-------------------------------------------------------------

The model inference logic is wrapped in a class that inherits from :class:`.PythonModel`. There are two
functions to implement:
